users have groups
groups have many users

right now, each user is getting every other users location data { userId, firstName, long, lat }

Without rooms or namespaces
  -- add a users groups to their socket
  -- when emitting data, could also attach the groupIds for that user
      -- on the front, sort all locations by groupId,
      -- would probably work
      -- not good b/c insecure. Each client gets every other clients locations
  -- when joining a group, sockets groupIds arr will need to be updated.
  -- same for leaving a group.
  -- Data would look like { userId, firstName, long, lat, groups: [groupId] }


  -- downside: lots of duplicate actions.
  will need an http req and socket emission for every action. Seems very not good.



What I think is ideal:
  -- build whole server architecture around sockets.
  -- use rooms / namespaces for groups.
  -- lots of stuff I don't know.






GROUPS API
-- get all groups for me.
  -- groups that I own, or am member of
  -- create groups
    -- add users to groups. no request for now, just add them by force haha.
      -- make this only owner?

-- delete groups
  -- only owner

-- remove users from groups
  -- owner
    -- owner and self
